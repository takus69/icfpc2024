      "Welcome to the Spaceship course!\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2020, most of us have learned how to operate a spaceship. In this course we'll play a small chess-like game featuring the spaceship! The game operates on an infinite 2D chess board, with the spaceship initially located on `(0,0)`. The spaceship has a velocity `vx` and `vy`, which are initially both set to `0`. In each turn the player can increase/decrease each of those numbers by at most one, and then the piece moves `vx` steps to the right and `vy` steps up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moves are represented with a single digit, inspired by the old numeric pad on a computer keyboard that we used to have in the old days on Earth. For example, `7` means decreasing `vx` and increasing `vy` by `1`, while `6` means increasing `vx` by `1` and keeping `vy` the same. A path can then be represented by a sequence of digits, e.g. the path `236659` visits, in this order, the following squares: `(0,0) (0,-1) (1,-3) (3,-5) (6,-7) (9,-9) (13,-10)`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the challenge is the following: given a list of squares to be visited, find a sequence of moves that visits all those squares. Your solution may consist of at most `10,000,000` moves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following levels are available:\n",

      "Welcome to the 3D course!\n",
      "\n",
      "Back in the old days, when the Cult of the Bound Variable still lived on earth, programming languages were still quite primitive. For example, people wrote their programs in 2D, thereby ignoring the third dimension of time. Clearly the spacetime complexity of a program is 3-dimensional, and in this course you will learn to optimize the spacetime volume of your programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below is a complete reference of the 3D language, which is a time-travel-oriented programming language. To keep the spacetime volume as small as possible, your program can use time warping to keep the time-axis small.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Syntax\n",
      "\n",
      "A 3D program is a text file that represents a 2D grid of cells. The rows are separated by newlines. Within each row, cells are represented by non-whitespace tokens separated by whitespace.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is human-friendly but not mandatory to keep the columns aligned by adding extra whitespace between cells; each row is processed separately. Rows do not have to have the same length; short rows are assumed to be left-aligned: empty on the right.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Available tokens\n",
      "\n",
      "* `.` represents an empty cell\n",
      "* an integer between `-99` and `99` (inclusive) represents that integer\n",
      "* the following characters\n",
      "  `<`, `>`, `^`, `v`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `@`, `=`, `#`, `S`, `A`, `B`\n",
      "  represent operators.\n",
      "  See [the operator reference](#operator-reference) for their meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Semantics\n",
      "\n",
      "The board is an infinite 2D grid of cells. Each cell is either empty or contains a value. A value is either an arbitrarily sized integer or an operator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Programs cannot contain arbitrarily sized integer literals. Integer literals can only range between `-99` and `99`, inclusive. This is a source-code-only restriction. At runtime, programs are free to compute with integers of arbitrary size.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Basic 2D reduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Time flows in discrete units, called ticks. The initial board is identical to the source code and its time coordinate is `t=1`. With each tick, we perform one round of reductions across the whole board simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "[The operator reference](#operator-reference) defines the reduction rules of all operators. Generally, all operators perform local rewriting on their surroundings. For example, the \"move right\" operator `>` rewrites `x > .` to `. > x`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operators are values, too, so `+ > .` reduces to `. > +`. This way, it's also possible to shuffle operators around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Binary operators, like `+`, `*`, or `-`, rewrite like this:\n",
      "```\n",
      ". y .     .  .   .\n",
      "x - .  ~> .  -  x-y\n",
      ". . .     . x-y  .\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Operators `A` and `B` are replaced with the input values (if any) after parsing. This mechanism is used to give different inputs to your program.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is operator `S`, which you can overwrite to terminate the program and submit the answer. It is an error to submit multiple different values, submitting the same value simultaneously multiple times is fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some reduction principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. If the preconditions of an operator are not met, reduction simply does not take place. For example, if a binary operator\n",
      "   has only one operand available, things stay as they are until the other operand arrives.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Outputs of operators overwrite the output cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "   `1 > +` reduces to `. > 1`\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Reading a value removes/consumes it.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Two operators can read from the same input cell at the same time. Both operators receive a copy of the input value before it's removed from the board.\n",
      "\n",
      "   `. < 6 > .` reduces to `6 < . > 6`\n",
      "\n",
